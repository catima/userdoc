Some CATIMA databases may be restricted to some users or group of users. To access a restrcited database, one must first have a CATIMA account and be connected.  
There are 2 ways to have access to a restrcited database: getting an **email** invitation by the catalog's administrator or having the secret code. This identifier is needed to join a group of users that is allowed to access the database.

**To join a group with a secret identifier**:
 
1. click on "**My groups**" in the menu that appears after clicking on your email
2. enter the identifier in the bar a click on **Join the group**.
