An advanced search on the datation field allows specifying periods in several different ways.

The datation field allows manual date entry. The dropdowns on the right allow specifying whether the search is for an exact date (1), after a date (2), or before a date (3).

The dropdown (4) enables searches through a choice set.

The ***Exclude*** criterion (5) allows excluding one or the other of the datation format. Excluding records with **manual datation** will only return records with **choice set datation** and vice versa.

The criteria can be combined using the search operators "and," "or," and "exclude," which are located on the left.

The operator before the first row (6) refers to other search fields. All others allow multiple criteria within the date field to interact.

>  **Reminder:**
> 
> **AND** (6): all criteria must be fulfilled
> 
> **OR** (7): either of the criteria must be fulfilled
> 
> **EXCLUDE** (8): the criterion must be excluded
