> The datation field is a very complex field for which [a complete manual](assets/datation/exampledatation.pdf) has been produced, as well as an [example catalog](https://catima.unil.ch/datation-exple/en) showing how the field is used and how it behaves when searched.

**Differences between "Date" and "datation" Fields**

The **Date** field allows the entry of a specific date on a record. This date must be unique. For example, it could be a person's birthdate, a building's construction year, or the date and time of a performance.

The **Date Field** accepts a start date and an end date, allowing the creation of periods and searching for all dates within that period.

### Simple Search

Searching for a period in the search bar will only return items in which the searched characters appear in any fields. A simple search doesn't calculate periods.

Thus, entering two dates in the search bar won't calculate a period but will return items in which both dates are textually present.
