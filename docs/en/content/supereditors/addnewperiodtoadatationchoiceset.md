Add a new choice by clicking *+ New Choice* to add a new period or specific date. There are several possibilities:

- The *Start Date* and *End Date* fields are filled with two different dates. They define a period from one date to another, including all dates between them.
- Only the *Start Date* field is filled. It defines a period after the indicated start date (included).
- Only the *End Date* field is filled. It defines a period before the indicated end date (included).
- Filling both fields with the same information sets a fixed date. For example, *Start Date*: 1990 and *End Date*: 1990.

> Start and end dates are **inclusive**. A period defined with a start date of **1990** and an end date of **1999** includes the years 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999. Searching for any of these years will return records from this period.
