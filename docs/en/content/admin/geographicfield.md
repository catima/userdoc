The geographic field is used to set an item's location. It is set by drag and drop'ing a point on the map or with coordinates. It also allows to add lines and polygons to the map. In set-up mode it is possible to choose the initial zoom level i.e. how zoomed the map will be when the item is openened.
A single items can have multiple locations.

**Geographic fields order**
Warning, if there are multiple geographic fields in the catalog, the features that use georaphic data, like the advanced search on the geographic field or the map containers, **only take into account the data stored in the first geographic field as they are positioned in the set-up.**
