This field is for a hierarchical choice list with multiple values. It can accept a only a single selection or multiple ones. Here is an example of what the choice set field looks like when adding data:

> Note: the add ![](assets/buttons/add_btn.png) button is only available to super-editors, not simple editors.

The list of available **choice sets** is on the *Choices* page that is accessible from the left sidebar. Each choice can have children which can also have their own children. This allows the user to structure the choice sets. Each choice can be selected, event those that have children.

When a choice set is not in use anymore, there are two options: 

- **deactivate** it: this option leaves the choice set available in "Set up" but can't be used in "Data". It can be reactivated if needed.
- **delete** it: completely deletes the choice set.
