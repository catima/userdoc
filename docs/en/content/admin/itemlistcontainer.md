After selecting a unique slug and the item type to be displayed, choose to sort the items in *ascending* or *descending* order (alphabetically), creation date or modification date. With grid, list and thumb styles the order (ascending or descending) is created based on the primary field. Whith line style, a new option appears and it is possible to choose the field to sort the items.

> **Example**: let's say we have an item type **Book** with the following fields: *Title* (primary field), *Author*, *Publishing date* and *Illustration*. When chosing grid, list or thumb style sorting is done on *Title*. With line style it can be on *Title*, *Author* or *Publishing date*. *Illustration* will not be a possible choice as it can't be alphabetically sorted.
