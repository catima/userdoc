It is important to consider the type of data that will be added to the catalog and how it will be structured before starting to add it. This reflective stage will help define catalog's conceptual and logical structure and facilitate the realization in CATIMA.  
At this stage, we are grouping different **data** together under a same **concept**.   
> For example "Titanic", "The Godfather" and "2001: A Space Odyssey" can be grouped together as "***movies***".

When there are multiple objects (or data) of one type each can have different features. To stay with the movies example, each movie has a ***Title***, ***Director***, ***Genre*** and ***Release date***. This information can be displayed in a table: 

| Title      | Genre | Director | Release date |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Titanic      | Drama       | James Cameron | 1998 |
| The Godfather   | Crime        | Francis Ford Coppola | 1972 |
| 2001: A Space Odyssey   | Science-fiction      | Stanley Kubrick | 1968 |

The next steps show one way to conceptualize a dataset.
