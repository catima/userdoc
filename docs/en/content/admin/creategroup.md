Groups can be used to grant different levels of access to a specific group of users or to add a large number of people at once.

To create a group, click on "*+ Create group*":

Next, enter a name and description for the group.

Define whether the group is active or not using the *Active?* checkbox. An inactive group will not have access to the catalog. The active checkbox can be checked or unchecked at any time by returning to the group settings via the *Edit* button ![Edit Button](assets/buttons/edit_btn.png).

Click on create a group.

It is then possible to assign the same role to all members of the group (here "Member"):

> Note: When a user has a role assigned individually *and* a role assigned via a group, the higher role takes precedence.
