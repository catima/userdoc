> The datation field is a very complex field for which [a complete manual](assets/datation/exampledatation.pdf) has been produced, as well as an [example catalog](https://catima.unil.ch/datation-exple/en) showing how the field is used and how it behaves when searched.

The datation field is a field that allows for **flexible datation** of an item. It differs from the date/time field by offering the possibility of considering periods in addition to specific dates.
Searches by date can then be conducted based on a predefined period, user-defined period, or according to a specific date.

This field accepts two types of date input formats when creating new items:

- Manual entry by date/time: For each added item, input a start and/or an end of period manually.
- Choice set entry: Pre-create a choice set of *datation type* and populate it with relevant periods for the project. Then select a choice when creating the item.

> Both options can be offered for the same item type. It is possible to choose between a predefined period or to manually create one at the time of entering a new item. **However, it's not possible to input both formats in a single item.**

##### Usage Example

For a project involving an inventory of objects in a Swiss heritage building, Catima is used for referencing and dating collections. While the available information for datation of an object can sometimes be quite vague at the beginning of the process (object style, use of a technique, name of a manufacturer), as the project progresses and new documents and clues are discovered, the datation of objects becomes more precise. It's in this context that the datation choice set was designed, allowing for multiple datation clues (style, artisan, use of a technique) to be assigned. If evidence allowing for a more precise datation of an object (such as the discovery of a letter indicating the exact year of the object's creation) were to emerge , then the datation of the object could transition to manual entry to enter a specific date.

Subsequently, a person visiting the catalog will be able to search according to the datation of the recorded objects. They can search for specific dates and find objects dated to that date or including that date within the attributed period. They can search period by manually entering start and end dates or by selecting a predefined period from a choice list. They can also cross-reference periods, exclude dates, or cross-reference criteria with other fields.

##### Differences between "datation" and "date" Fields

The **date** field allows the entry of a specific date on a record. This date must be unique. It can be, for example, a person's birth date, the year of construction of a building, or the time and date of a performance.

The **datation** field accepts a start date and an end date, allowing for the creation of periods and searches on all dates contained within that period.
