It is possible to invite people to see a private catalog or colaborate by changing their status. They will get an email with the invite. To edit a user's status, got to **Users & groups** in the left sidebar on the "Set up" page.

Status can be changed in two ways: 

1. One person at a time: search for the user and click on edit ![](assets/buttons/edit_btn.png). After selcting a prefered language, their status can be updated. 
2. Use the *Group* setting: add a new group, give it a name and description.

If the "Public" checkbox is not checked, only members with an email invitation are part of the group. To add members to the group with email adresses, click on the ![](assets/groups/usergroup_icon.png) icon. 

If the "Public" checkbox is checked, CATIMA will create a password that can be shared with anybody. This pasword is the key to be part of the group. 
> To generate the password, check the "Public" checkbox, update the group and edit it again.

Users can also be given editor or super-editor status the same way.

> Users won't be able to see the catalog if its visibiliy is set on *Open to members* or *Open to catalog staff.
> Members won't be able to see the catalog if its visibility is set on *Open to catalog staff*.
> To change the catalog's visibility, go to *Set up > General > Catalog visibility*
