We will now add some order to the list of elements. We want to find what are the important concepts and what features do they have.
> Note: an element can be a feature of a concept and a concept as the same time: see "*Links and references*".  

In the movie example, the core concept is ***Movie*** since the catalog's goal is to list movies. But ***Director*** can also be a concept if it is considered useful to know additional features about them such as "*Date of birth*", "*Nationality*" or "*Biography*".
