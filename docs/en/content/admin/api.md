Catima offers the possibility to get a catalog's informations through an API. *This option has to be activated by a system administrator. To activate your catalog's API, contact the persons in charge of the project.*

### Who can access the data ?

One must either have a Catima account, be logged in and have access to the catalog to be able to use it's API (password method) or have the catalog's API key (API key method). The available data with the password method is the same than the data that the user has access to and can be restricted while the API key method grants access to the full catalog. For this reason, **never publicly share an API key.**

Create and delete API keys in from the **API** tab in "Set Up" mode. It is possible to have several API keys at the same time.

More informations for API requests can be foud [in the documentation](https://catimalb.unil.ch/api-docs/index.html).

### Data only mode

A data only mode can be activated is Catima is only used to store data and a frontend catalog is not needed to access and visualize the items.

**In data only mode:**

- items can not be accessed via a catalog site by visitors
- there are no visualization options (menu, pages, visitors' statistics)
- access to data and set up mode can still be separated by role (editor, reviewer, administrator)

*This option has to be activated by a system administrator. Contact the persons in charge of the project if interested.*
