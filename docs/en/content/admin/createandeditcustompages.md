CATIMA has a default mode to display the item to the final user. This mode can not be modified, but we can create **pages** where the layout can be modified as needed.

To add a new page, click on **Pages** in the left sidebar while in *Set up* mode and click on *New page* then add a slug and title and confirm by clicking on **Create page** - or **Create and add another** if you need to add more.

Then to modify the page, click on edit ![i](assets/buttons/edit_btn.png) and the *Edit page* page will open. The slug and title can be modified and content can be added in the *Containers* section.

> If the catalog is multilingual, there will be one container per language on the *Edit page* page. Adding an elemenet to one container doesn't automatically add it to the other ones.

Different kind of content containers can be added to a page:

- **Contact**: adds a form that allows users to send an email to specified email adress.
- **HTML**: displays a visual editor to write formatted text, links (URLs) and add images or videos. A code editor also allows advanced users to enter HTML code directly. It is this container that is used to embed media.
- **Item List**: this container display a list of a selected item. Different styles are availables (list, grid, thumb). *Maximum one per page*
- **Map**: displays a map with a specified item type's localisation. The item must have a *Geographic field*.
- **Markdown**: to add text, tables and images with Markdown syntax.
- **Search**: displays the results of a previously saved search. *Maximum one per page*
