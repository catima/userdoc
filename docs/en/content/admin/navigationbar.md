The navigation bar is customizable: it is possible to add or remove items as well as change the order. To do this acces the **Menu items** settings in the left sidebar while in *Set up* mode. The current items displayed in the navigation bar are listed with their rank. An *Item type*, *Custom page* or *External URL* can be in the navigation bar.

Settings can be adjusted by editing an existing item or creating a new one. Apart from the usual slug (short name that must only have small cap letters without accents, numbers or hypens) and title, the options are:

- **Rank**: change the item's order by changing its rank. The items are displayed from left to right in ascending order. 
- **Parent**: To create a drop-down menu:
	- Create a *Parent* menu item; this is the name that will appear in the navigation bar. Only fill in the slug, title and rank fields. 
	- To add *Child* menu items - options that will appear when the parent is clicked, create a new item or edit an existing one and add the *Parent* item in the parent field.   

> It is not possible for a child item to have other children.
