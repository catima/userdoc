The map container is used to display a geographic map of a item type that has a geographic location attribute (e.g. location of all swiss universities with geographic field). It has different options: 
	-  The item to be displayed on the map can be selected vie the **Item type** field. It will be possible to choose items that have a location attribute - items that don't have location attribute will not appear in the list:
