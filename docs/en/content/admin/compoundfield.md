The compound field allows to gather the data from other fields and to format it. It can be used to display bibliographical references. <br> The field can only be edited in *set-up mode*. It compounds the data edited in *data mode* and the result is displayed when consulting the item.

**Example** <br>
We want to list movie references in a set format. The "Movie" items contain a number of fields, including the following: "Title", "Original title", "Director", "Year of release", "Country of production".
We want to display the reference as follows.

> *Title* (Director, Country, Year).

In the compound field, choose the fields using the drop-down list and format it as required.

**Multilingual catalog** <br>
The compound field can differ from one language to another. Leaving it blank in one language or the other results in a blank field. 

If the catalog is in french, we want to reference the movies in a different way. The reference should appear as follows:

> *Title* (*Original title*, Director, Year).
