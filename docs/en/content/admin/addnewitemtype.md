After deciding which concepts and features will be used in the catalog, it is time to start adding item types. No data is added yet, this is where the item types and its fields are defined.  

First, acess the set up page by clicking on **Admin** > **Catalog set up** in the navigation bar. One must be connected to CATIMA and and be an administrator to perform this action.  

If some items have already been created, they will be displayed on the top-left of the page. Click on the "*New item type*" button to create a new one.

The *New item type* form opens:

**Name**: add the item name. If different languages are selected, all fields must be completed.  
**Slug**: the slug is a short name that will appear in the website's address (URL). It must contain only letters (without accent), numbers and hyphens and must be short.  
> Example: for the item "University" the slug could be "uni".

In the **Display options**, if ***Display empty fields*** is selected, all fields will appear to the catalog's visitors, even if those are empty. If you do not wish empty fields to be shown, deselect this option.
