When creating a group, you have the option to check the "Public?" box, which is especially useful if the goal is to add many people at once. This will generate a private id that can be shared with, for example, all students of the Fall 2018 semester, who can then join this group.

To have CATIMA generate this private id, save the changes by clicking "Create group," then go back to the group by clicking on the "Edit" icon to be able to read and share it.
