**Alowing search engines to display your catalog**

The default setting for Catima catalogs does not allow search engines such as Google to display the catalog's data. To allow it, reach out to your contact in the Catima team.

**Exclude a specific item type from being displayed in search engines**

Once the option to display your catalog in search engines is activated, every item types is automatically displayed. You can manually exclude specific item types from showing up. In **Set-up** mode, select the item type you want to exclude and choose *Edit item type* and uncheck the "Indexable (SEO)" box.
