The HTML container allows users to integrate medias such as videos, infographics and more to pages. Unlike the [embed field](#embed-field), this method allows the content to be displayed full width on the page. 

For the integration to be possible, the site where the media is located must be explicitly authorized explicitly by Catima. It has to be part of the authorized domains‘ list.

e.g. to add a youtube video to an item, the domain youtube.com has to be authorized by Catima - which it is.
Non-exhaustive list of authorized domains:

Youtube (*.youtube.com)
Viméo (*.vimeo.com)
To know the exhaustive list of authorized domains contact the persons in charge of the project.

1. Create a new or edit a HTML container and enter "Code View" mode.

2. Get the iframe tag from the internet page where the media currently is by clicking on Share > Embed. The iframe tag is some text that starts with `<iframe` and ends with `</iframe>`. Copy and paste it intot the HTML editor.

3. Click on the "Code View" button again to go back to standard editing more. 
4. Save your work by clicking on the save or create container button. 

> It is critical to switch back to normal editing more before saving or creating the container with the button at the bottom of the page, otherwise the changes will be lost !

### Tip
