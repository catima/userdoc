**Suggestions** are a way for catalog's users to send their comments to the editors and administrators. This could be used to notify about an error in a specific item. Those **Suggestions** are private and not publicly displayed on the catalog; they are sent by email to the adress defined by the administrator and are visible in data mode.

To activate this option, select **Enable suggestions**. Unless the **Enable anonymous suggestions** is checked, only users with a Catima account can send suggestions.
