Click on the *Add users* button (icon ![](assets/setup/usergroup_icon.png))

The list of members is displayed. Click on *Add users* and then enter the email addresses of the users to add. Be sure to follow the following formatting: **one address per line and no special characters.** It is recommended to send invitations in small batches rather than all at once.

Finalize by clicking on *Add members*.

The members will be notified by email. If they do not have a Catima account, they will be invited to create one.
