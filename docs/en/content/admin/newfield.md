Once the new item created, it is time to add fields that will hold the data. Fields are the item's *features*. 

> A "*Movie*" item's fields could be a text field for the title, a date field for the release date and a choiceset field for its genre.

The number of fields an item can have isn't limited.

To add a new field to an item: 

1. On the *set up* page, select the item in the item list
2. Click on the **Add** button on the top right of the page
