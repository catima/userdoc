# Search

All CATIMA's databases have a search features that can be used to look for elements through keywords. It can be a simple search with one keyword or a more advanced one that can include multiple keywords and exclude others.   

Both are accessible through the catalog's search bar on the homepage.  
> To access the homepage, click on the catalog's name on the left side of the navigation bar.

## Advanced search

The advanced search is for searching within **elements of a specific item**. To access the advanced search page, click on the *Advanced* link on the right side of the search button; you will be redirected to a new page.

By default, the item searched is the first one in alphabetical order. This can be changed by clicking on *Default search by item type* and choosing a different item. Then each field can be searched using a keyword or exact wording. It is also possible to filter elements by name or category. 

### Boolean operators
It is possible to use advanced search with boolean operators: 
 
- Operator "**AND**" (default) is used to combine search words and narrow results. This tells the database that *all* search terms must be present in the results. 
- Operator "**OR**"; two search terms linked with **OR** will return all results that match with either one or the other
- Operator "**EXCLUDE**" is used to excludes results that match a given term.
